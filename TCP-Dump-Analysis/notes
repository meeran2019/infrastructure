tcpdump host ip-addr                    -> disply traffic in/out of ip address.
tcpdump src source-ip-addr              -> filter based on source ip address.
tcpdump dst dest-ip-address             -> filter based on destination ip address.
tcpdump net 10.11.12.13/24              -> display traffic in/out of subnet. 
tcpdump port 3389                       -> display traffic for specific port. 

tcpdump some-filters -w file-name       -> write output to file. 
-D  -> Show list of interfaces.
-l  -> line readable output.
