Common Issues faced in JAVA:

    OOM (Out of Memory Exception) in JVM.
    Memory Leaks
    Excessive GC (Garbage collector).
    Improper Caching.
    Threads (Thread deadlock, resource contention).
    Database

Heap Memory:
    It is all about objects.
    This is the place where store the object details. 
    It is dynamic memory allocation of java objects. 
    xms (minimum) and xmx (maximum).
    Garbage collector runs in backgroup to freeup heap memory that dont have any reference. 
    Any object created in heap space has global access and can be reference from anywhere in application.
    It can change by increasing/decreasing value. 

Stack Memory:
    Used for execution of thread.
    It always referenced in LIFO order. 
    Whenever method is invoked, new block is created in stack. 
    It is statically allocated memory. 
    It store primitive values and object reference. 
    It cannot change the space value (increase/decrease)

Garbage Collection: 
    In JAVA, Garbage means unreferenced objects. 
    It is process of reclaiming unused object memory. 
    It is automatically done by garbage collector in JVM.

    Objects can be unreferenced by,
        1. By nulling a reference, 
                Employee e=new Employee();
                e=null;  
        2. By assigning a reference to another, 
                Employee e1=new Employee();  
                Employee e2=new Employee(); 
                e1=e2   (Moving e2 to e1 and e1 object memory is available for garbage collection)
        3. By anonymous object,
                new Employee();
